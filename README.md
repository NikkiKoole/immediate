* An immediate renderer build on SDL2.

Hopefully this lib will enable me to write code a little like this:

    beginDraw()
        drawVertices(..)
        drawCircle(..)
        drawImage(..)
        drawRect(..)
        drawLine(..)
        drawText(..)
    flushDraw()

And dont fuss about with how its organized behind the scenes.
